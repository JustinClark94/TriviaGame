These assignments are getting more and more challenging. Even the 'easy' ones! Which is a good thing.

I chose the easy assignment and probably the most difficult parts were figuring out how to put the questions and answers on the screen. 

Once I got them on the screen I had a problem putting them in the correct order. Orginially, all the questions appeared in one block and all of the answers were beneath it.

Another thing I realized this week was that I still don't have that instint to use semicolons and properly indent my code. That's something I'll be more aware of going forward.
